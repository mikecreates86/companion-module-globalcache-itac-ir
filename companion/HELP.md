## Global Caché iTach IR

Control projectors, displays and other IR devices through a Global Caché iTach IP2IR or WF2IR. Other Global Caché units that speak the same TCP API (GC-100, Flex) should also work by setting the IR module address.

### Setup

1. Enter the **IP address** of the iTach. Find it with the iHelp utility or in your router's DHCP client list. Give the iTach a fixed IP or a DHCP reservation so it can't move.
2. Leave **TCP Port** at 4998 and **IR Module Address** at 1 for an iTach.
3. After connecting, the log lists the modules the device reports. If the module address doesn't point to an IR module, the connection shows a warning.

### Capturing IR codes

Download the free iLearn and iHelp utilities from [Global Caché Support Downloads](https://www.globalcache.com/downloads/). Mac versions are available from [http://www.rmartijnr.eu/](http://www.rmartijnr.eu/).

1. Select the device type you're learning from in the IR Learner dropdown menu (Autodetect Type).
2. Enter the IP address of the Global Caché device and press **Connect**.
3. Leave Capture Options at their defaults.
4. Point the remote at the IR learning receiver and press the button you want to capture.
5. Select the Global Caché format in the **Format** dropdown menu.
6. Press **Edit** to move the captured code into the Edit field, then copy it.

Paste the code into the **Send IR code** action. These formats are accepted:

- Global Caché code: `38000,1,1,342,171,21,64,...`
- The full line from iLearn, including the header: `sendir,1:1,1,38000,1,1,...` (the header is removed automatically)
- Learned Pronto hex: `0000 006D 0022 0002 ...`

Spaces and line breaks are ignored. Codes are checked before sending, and problems are reported in the log and the `last_error` variable.

**Tip:** To reuse a code on many buttons, store it in a Companion custom variable and enter `$(internal:custom_projector_power)` as the IR code.

### Actions

- **Send IR code**: transmits a code on a port. The action completes once the iTach confirms the code was sent, so in a sequential action group the next step waits for it. Use _Repeat count_ for devices that need a code sent more than once to react.
- **Stop IR**: stops the code transmitting on a port and discards any waiting codes.
- **Clear queued codes**: discards codes waiting on every port.
- **Reconnect**: drops and re-opens the connection.
- **Send raw command (advanced)**: sends any Global Caché API command, e.g. `get_IR,1:1`.

**Hold to repeat (e.g. volume):** add _Send IR code_ with a repeat count of 50 on press and _Stop IR_ on release. The **Hold to repeat** presets are set up this way.

### How delivery works

- Each port sends one code at a time and waits for the iTach to confirm it before sending the next, so a quick second press never cuts off the first code. Ports work independently.
- If another controller is using the port (_busyIR_), the code is retried automatically (see **Retries**).
- Codes pressed while the device is offline are sent as soon as it reconnects, unless they've waited longer than **Discard codes not started within**. That keeps a power toggle from firing long after someone pressed it.
- If the connection drops while a code is sending, or no confirmation arrives, the code is **not** resent by default, because resending a toggle code (such as a single power button) would undo it. Enable **Also resend when delivery is unconfirmed** only if your codes are all discrete (e.g. separate Power On and Power Off codes).

### Recovery

- The connection is retried automatically, every second at first and backing off to every 5 seconds, until the device is back.
- An idle connection is checked every 10 seconds by default (**Connection check interval**). This catches a device that lost power or network without closing the connection, so it reconnects before the next button press instead of failing.
- A missing confirmation also triggers an immediate connection check.

### Feedbacks and variables

- **Device connected**, **Port sending**, and **Last code failed** feedbacks.
- Variables: `connection_status`, `firmware_version`, `queue_depth`, `last_port`, `last_result`, `last_error`, `last_latency_ms`, `sent_total`, `failed_total`, `reconnects`.

The **Status** preset shows the connection state, turns red when a code fails, and reconnects when pressed.

### Troubleshooting

- **ERR 005 / "Frequency ... out of range"**: part of the `sendir,...` header is still in the code. Paste the whole line from iLearn or only the part starting at the frequency.
- **"Port is busy"**: another controller (an app, a second Companion) is using the port.
- **Codes are confirmed but the device doesn't react**: check the emitter placement, or try a _Repeat count_ of 2–3.
- **Wi-Fi (WF2IR) drops out**: increase **Response timeout**.
